# Principal-Component-Analysis
It's a subset of thesis task
Principal component analysis is basically a dimentionalty reduction technique by which we can find the correlation between data points. It helps to reduce features of the data and finds the most signifannt components gradually.
Steps of PCA:
>Standardization of data
>Computing the covarience matrix
>Calculating the eigenvectors and eigenvalues
>Computing the principal components
>Reducing the dimension of Data
